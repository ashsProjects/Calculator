# Calculator
This is a GUI of two calculators I created in Java. One is an infix expression calculator, which lets you evaluate expressions as you would type them
in math follwing order if operations. The second calculator is a descriptive statistics calculator, which lets you input data values in a text field
and displays the results based on that. The GUI features custome UI and Look and Feel. The calculator also has a history feature that stores the previous 
calculations in a text file and reads that at the start of the program to build the history.
